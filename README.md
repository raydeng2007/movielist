Working React Web application for sharing and keeping track of 
the movies that you wanted to watch but keep forgetting 
whenever you need a movie to watch. 

You'll be able to edit/delete/update/add new movies to 
your current list. 

Built with React/REDUX. For useage clone this repo and 
in your bash `cd` to the directory and run `npm install`
and then run `npm start`. The application will be running on 
`http://localhost:3000/`



P.S: Still need to update styling, sorry for poor UI for
now.
